# cocos2d-x-gd

Recreating rob's modifications to cocos2d-x v2.2.3.

Can currently open GD itself, but will crash soon after loading.

## Why
For fun, mostly

## How to run GD
Copy the built libcocos and `pthreadVC2.dll` from the dlls folder (it will be static linked some day) into an instance of 2.2074 GD
